## Concentration Checks (D&D 5th Edition only)

![concentrator](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/concentrator.gif)

A DM is responsible for all sorts of things, but keeping track those pesky spell casters and their concentration is one more thing that you shouldn't have to worry about! With this gadget, you can make sure that those *irritating* spellcasters are always checked whenever the concentrating status is applied. Now they'll be careful about getting hit by that goblin sneaking around!

## Enhanced Conditions

![enhanced-conditions](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/enhanced-conditions.gif)

It's not enough to *show* your players when their poisoned, you want to really drive it  home by linking the condition so they can wallow in misery as they fail their ability checks.

This gadget creates a dynamo-powered link between token status icons and journal entries with further info on that status effect.

### Condition Lab

In here you can mix up your ~~nefarious~~ heroic combination of status icons and condition names.

*I like the Deadly STD one!*

## Hide NPC Names

![hide-npc-names](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/hide-npc-names.gif)

Maybe you forgot that your NPC's name reveals a dark secret about their past, or maybe you forgot to give them a name.

Fret no more, for this gadget replaces NPC names with a replacement of your choice. Personally, I'm a fan of Melvin.

## Mark Injured/Dead Tokens

*deprecated* Instead use Triggler to create triggers to add injured/dead conditions to your tokens!

## Mighty Summoner (Druid Circle of the Shepherd class feature) support (D&D5e only)
*full write up coming soon*

## Pan/Select Token
*full write up coming soon*

## Quick Edit Token Resource from Combat Tracker
*full write up coming soon*

## Reroll Initiative

![reroll-initiative](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/reroll-initiative.gif)

The BBEG rolled a 2 for initiative? Not anymore! This gadget rerolls initiative for all combatants each round.

Glorious chaos!

## Roll Initiative from Actor Sheet

## Temporary Combatants

## Thanks/Attribution
Firstly thanks to everyone who has downloaded the mod, and a special thank you to everyone who provided bug reports or feedback on discord or here on github!

Secondly I want to shout out the awesome contributors for this module: Reaver01, JacobMcAuley and Moerill! Without your code, Combat Utility Belt would not be as awesome as it is!

A big thanks to trdischat#2123 on the Foundry Discord for the awesome set of condition icons used in the `Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition` mapping.

I would like to acknowledge that many of the functions found in the Combat Utility Belt are inspired by API scripts for Roll20 written by Robin Kuiper (namely the Combat Tracker, Death Tracker and StatusInfo ones).
