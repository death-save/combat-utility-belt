 Every ~~hero~~ GM needs gadgets to keep their game safe from dastardly players up to no good!

 ## Reroll Initiative

 The BBEG rolled a 2 for initiative? Not anymore! This gadget rerolls initiative for all combatants each round.

 Glorious chaos!

 ## Hide NPC Names

 Maybe you forgot that your NPC's name reveals a dark secret about their past, or maybe you forgot to give them a name.

 Fret no more, for this gadget replaces NPC names with a replacement of your choice. Personally, I'm a fan of Melvin.

 ## Enhanced Conditions

 ![enhanced-conditions](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/enhanced-conditions.gif)

 It's not enough to *show* your players when their poisoned, you want to really drive it  home by linking the condition so they can wallow in misery as they fail their ability checks.

 This gadget creates a dynamo-powered link between token status icons and journal entries with further info on that status effect.

 ### Condition Lab

 In here you can mix up your ~~nefarious~~ heroic combination of status icons and condition names.

 *I like the Deadly STD one!*

 ## Mark Injured/Dead Tokens

 Ack! Gasp! I'm bloodied! What does that even mean? Who knows?!

 Well, now *you* do! With this gadget you can define a threshold (% of hp) that marks a token as injured. This gadget can also mark tokens as dead when their hp reaches 0. Outstanding! Now my players will have no doubt that I am the most ~~evil~~ heroic GM there was!

## Thanks/Attribution
Firstly thanks to everyone who has downloaded the mod, and a special thank you to everyone who provided bug reports or feedback!

I need to acknowledge that many of the functions found in the Combat Utility Belt are inspired by API scripts for Roll20 written by Robin Kuiper (namely the Combat Tracker, Death Tracker and StatusInfo ones).

A big thanks to trdischat#2123 on the Foundry Discord for the awesome set of condition icons used in the `Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition` mapping.
Thanks to hooking#0492 for the Pathfinder 2nd Edition condition mapping for use with his Pathfinder 2nd Edition system!
